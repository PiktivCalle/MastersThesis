### Environment variables

In order to run the program, a few environmental variables need to be declared in a file called _.env_ located in the root folder.

The format of the .env file must be something like:

    OPENAI_API_KEY = // API key from Open AI

    OLLAMA_URI = // URI of Ollama server

    NEO4J_URI = // URI of the Neo4j database
    NEO4J_USER = // Username of Neo4j user
    NEO4J_PASSWORD = // Password of Neo4j user
